# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Genome-2-Art exists at the intersection of science and art — two fields that thrive on diverse perspectives, open inquiry, and collaborative discovery. We are committed to fostering a community where contributors from all backgrounds can participate in advancing this vision.

## Our Values

### Collaboration Over Competition
Science and art both progress through building on the work of others. We encourage:
- Sharing knowledge freely
- Helping others learn and grow
- Celebrating collective achievements
- Giving proper attribution

### Intellectual Curiosity
We welcome questions, experimentation, and unconventional thinking:
- No question is too basic
- Challenge ideas respectfully, not people
- Embrace the unknown — that's where discovery happens
- Value both rigorous analysis and creative intuition

### Inclusive Excellence
Great ideas come from everywhere:
- Scientists, artists, developers, and curious minds are all welcome
- Expertise in one area doesn't require expertise in all areas
- Different perspectives strengthen the work
- Accessibility matters — in code, documentation, and communication

## Expected Behavior

- **Be respectful** — Treat others as you would want to be treated
- **Be constructive** — Offer feedback that helps improve the work
- **Be patient** — Remember that contributors have varying experience levels
- **Be open-minded** — Consider viewpoints different from your own
- **Be accountable** — Own your mistakes and learn from them

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Dismissing contributions based on the contributor's background
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Trolling, insulting comments, or deliberate intimidation
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Special Considerations

### Handling Genetic Data
This project deals with sensitive biological information. Contributors must:
- Never share real genetic data without explicit consent
- Maintain the project's commitment to local-only processing
- Respect the privacy implications of genomic information
- Use mock or public research data for testing and examples

### Scientific Integrity
When contributing scientific features:
- Be honest about the accuracy and limitations of visualizations
- Don't make claims the data doesn't support
- Welcome peer review and correction
- Distinguish between established science and artistic interpretation

### Artistic Expression
When contributing artistic features:
- Respect that aesthetics are subjective
- Provide rationale for design choices when helpful
- Be open to alternative artistic visions
- Remember that the art serves to illuminate the science

## Enforcement

### Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers directly. All reports will be handled with discretion.

### Response
Maintainers will review reported incidents and take appropriate action, which may include:
- A private conversation to address the behavior
- A public or private warning
- Temporary or permanent removal from the project

### Appeals
Anyone who believes they have been unfairly sanctioned may appeal by contacting the maintainers with their perspective.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- Project repositories and issue trackers
- Pull request discussions
- Project-related communications
- Any space where you represent the project

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and adapted to reflect the unique science-art focus of this project.
