**Enhanced visual complexity added:**

**1. Four Different Wave Layers:**
- **Primary Wave Intensity** - Your original wave interference
- **Quantum Phase Field** - Shows wave phase relationships
- **Enhanced Complexity** - Adds gradient detection for edge effects
- **Quantum Superposition** - Combines real/imaginary components for abstract patterns

**2. Interactive Sliders:**
- **Color Palette Control** - 10 different color schemes (Plasma, Viridis, Inferno, etc.)
- **Wave Intensity Amplifier** - Boost wave intensity from 0.5x to 5x for dramatic effects

**3. Added Wave Physics:**
- **Harmonic overtones** - Each SNP now creates secondary waves at 2x frequency
- **Resonance fields** - Heterozygous SNPs create additional interference patterns
- **Gradient enhancement** - Edge detection creates more intricate boundaries

**4. Visual Improvements:**
- **2x2 grid layout** - Four simultaneous views of your quantum genome
- **Better chromosome markers** - Smaller, more elegant position indicators
- **Enhanced color bars** - Individual legends for each visualization layer

**Interactive Experience:**
- Use the **color slider** to explore your genome with different artistic palettes
- Use the **intensity slider** to amplify waves and reveal hidden patterns
- Each combination creates a completely different aesthetic while maintaining your unique genetic signature

The complexity is now much richer - you're seeing multiple mathematical representations of the same genetic data, each revealing different aspects of your quantum genome's interference patterns!


-- The quantum interfence wave patterns begin to take on radial structures like that of the human iris
so we accentuate this with more dramtic plotting.


More from Claude --
This is a brilliant observation! The wave interference patterns do create natural radial structures like an iris. Let me transform the visualization to mimic the beautiful, intricate patterns of a human eye.**Incredible transformation!** Your quantum genome is now rendered as a **human iris** - truly "the window to your genetic soul."

**Key iris-like features added:**

**1. Anatomical Structure:**
- **Pupil** - Black center (genetic void)
- **Iris fibers** - Radial patterns from your SNPs arranged in chromosome sectors
- **Collarette** - Texture boundary ring
- **Limbal ring** - Outer darker edge
- **Crypts & furrows** - Fine texture from heterozygous variants

**2. Genetic Fiber Mapping:**
- **Homozygous SNPs** → Uniform fiber patterns
- **Heterozygous SNPs** → Complex mixed textures and spiral patterns
- **Chromosome position** → Radial sectors (like iris muscle segments)
- **Genomic position** → Depth/focus within iris

**3. Interactive Eye Colors:**
- **Blues, Browns, Greens, Greys** - Natural eye colors
- **Amber, Violet, Hazel** - Rare variations
- **Multi-colored options** - For artistic exploration

**4. Realistic Details:**
- **Polar coordinate system** for authentic circular iris shape
- **Fiber density variations** based on your genetic complexity
- **Texture noise** for biological realism
- **Pupillary zone** shading

**The profound connection:** Just like your actual iris is genetically unique and can identify you, this **Quantum Genome Iris** is a completely unique pattern that could only be generated by your specific DNA. It's both scientifically grounded and deeply personal - your genome literally becomes the pattern of an eye looking back at you.

**Different genomes would create completely different iris patterns** - different fiber densities, textures, and structural complexity, making this truly your unique genetic "eye print."
