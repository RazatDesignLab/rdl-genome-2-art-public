# Contributing to Genome-2-Art

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Genome-2-Art! This project lives at the intersection of science and art, and we welcome contributions that advance how these two disciplines complement each other.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that scientific data carries inherent beauty, and that artistic visualization can reveal patterns and insights that traditional analysis might miss. Contributions are valued when they:

- **Bridge disciplines** — Bring perspectives from genetics, mathematics, physics, visual arts, or design
- **Maintain scientific integrity** — Ensure visualizations accurately represent underlying data
- **Enhance artistic expression** — Explore new ways to translate biological information into visual form
- **Respect privacy** — Keep genetic data processing local and secure

## Ways to Contribute

### Scientific Contributions
- Improve algorithms for genetic data interpretation
- Add support for new genome file formats
- Enhance the mathematical models (wave interference, quantum phase fields)
- Validate biological accuracy of visualizations
- Document the science behind the art

### Artistic Contributions
- Propose new visualization styles or color palettes
- Improve the aesthetic quality of generated art
- Design new ways to represent genetic variations
- Create documentation that explains the artistic vision
- Contribute example outputs that showcase possibilities

### Technical Contributions
- Fix bugs and improve code quality
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Improve cross-platform compatibility
- Enhance export options and file formats
- Write tests and improve reliability

### Documentation Contributions
- Improve setup instructions
- Write tutorials for new users
- Translate documentation
- Create guides for specific use cases

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally
2. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Explore the codebase:**
   - `genome-2-art_v2.py` — Human genome visualization
   - `viral-genome-2-art.py` — Viral genome visualization
4. **Make your changes** on a new branch
5. **Test your changes** with sample data
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- Ensure your code runs without errors
- Test with the provided mock data (`AncestryDNA_mock.txt`)
- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Update documentation if needed

### PR Description
Please include:
- **What** — A clear summary of changes
- **Why** — The motivation behind the contribution
- **How** — Brief explanation of your approach
- **Science/Art balance** — How your contribution serves both aspects (if applicable)

### Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Include docstrings for new functions
- Comment complex algorithms, especially mathematical transformations
- Keep privacy in mind — never transmit genetic data externally

## Proposing New Features

For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss:

1. **The vision** — What do you want to achieve?
2. **Scientific basis** — What biological or mathematical principles are involved?
3. **Artistic merit** — How does this enhance the visual output?
4. **Implementation approach** — How might this be built?

We value thoughtful discussion before major development efforts.

## Community Standards

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Welcome newcomers from any background — science, art, or code
- Give credit where due
- See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for detailed guidelines

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for:
- Help getting started
- Clarification on the codebase
- Discussion of ideas before implementation
- Feedback on the project direction

We're excited to see how the community can expand the possibilities of genome visualization. Whether you're a geneticist, an artist, a developer, or simply curious — your perspective is welcome here.
